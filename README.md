# Arbiter Client

> Started with the belief that the process and product should be indistinguishable from one another, Arbiter is an attempt to codify Agile software development.
> If the end result of the process is a software product, can the end result of a software product be a process? 

> Arbiter attempts to move as much of the process as possible into repeatable, reliable code. Leaving agile teams with only the work that is closest to the product.
